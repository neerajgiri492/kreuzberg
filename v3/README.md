# Kreuzberg v3 (LTS Compatibility)

This directory packages the legacy v3 Python API for compatibility users. For new projects, use the v4+ releases in the repository root.

Key points:
- Matches the v3 surface (including `OCRConfig`) with updated dependencies.
- Built and published via the `publish-v3.yaml` manual workflow.
